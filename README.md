# Your_Shape_final
An app that uses Genetic Algorithm to make design evolve automatically
*/
Designers are continuously devoting to create new design to satisfy user’s demands and preference, but we must admit that since everyone is different, so there does not exist one perfect design for everyone. However, what if design, like Darwin's theory of evolution, can evolve and update itself to fit users’ different demands? What if such a process happens even without being noticed? This project is more like a bold attempt, I try to apply genetic algorithm (GA) into visual design, and I create a simple APP prototype, but the result completely confirmed my very initial idea, design can indeed involve!
